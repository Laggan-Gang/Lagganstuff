                This story takes place in the lands of Carcinisnation, a world
                which is spread over the shell of a cosmic crab.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orgon City was founded around 100 years ago when settler John
                Orgon became fascinated with a strange mineral found exclusively
                in this coastline strip. Right where the ocean meets land, some
                strange rocks where forming, seemingly balanced between a liquid
                and a solid. Impossible to fully stabilize - yet impossible to
                sway either way.
            </p>
            <p>
                John Orgon would set up a massive mining operation to extract
                this substance, which he had humbly dubbed "Orgonite".
                Strangely, as soon as he had given Orgonite its name, Orgonite
                became a not only consensually accepted name for it, but the
                name became obvious and natural for the substance; even those
                who had not yet encountered Orgonite knew that its name was
                Orgonite.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orgonite seemed to have the power of increasing the power of
                perception. Although <i>not</i> in the sense of making one more
                perceptive, but rather that <i>in perceiving something</i> a
                <i>greater power than usual would be exercised</i>. Your
                impression of something, your ideas, your memories of something,
                come to influence the nature of said something. The concentrated
                Orgonite created a rift between Orgon City and the rest of the
                lands. Other towns wanted nothing to do with the metaphysical
                powers of the Orgonite citizens, and the people of Orgon would
                gladly leave the "backwater retrogrades" behind. Interestingly,
                as the Orgonite people saw neighboring areas as less developed,
                their perception was proven correct by the power of Orgonite,
                and indeed the technological developments of neighboring cities
                was strangely regressing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The City of Orgon went on to develop an economic structure based
                on laissez-faire capitalism (though it was pronounced
                "Laser-fraiser"), as literally anything else became impossible.
                Truly the economic structure of Minecraft could only
                meaningfully be achieved when the individual was factually
                strong enough to alter reality through perception. But a society
                needs consensus to hold onto its own ontology, which became
                increasingly difficult as citizens would inadvertently exercise
                their subjectivism on the world around them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city of Orgon fell into somewhat of a decline. Writing,
                photos, videos and records became scarce, rare and mostly
                useless - as they would keep changing retroactively, as the
                people would misremember or misinterpret things, which in turn
                would force the records to adapt to their perception. Science,
                municipal projects, law enforcement et cetera became impossible.
                Orgon would flourish as long as the power of Orgonite could
                compensate for the lack of structure - social security would
                never be needed as long as basic needs could be met with pure
                idealism. Time mached on. Orgonite was no longer as potent as it
                was when John Orgon discovered it.
            </p>
            <p>Orgon City was becoming unstable. It needed a miracle.</p>
            <p>
                It was at this point that a funky angel from a different world
                enters the stage. Lina, "the HOYL,", from her vantage point of
                being the least likely rung on the ladder of chance, had seen
                and taken pity on the city. As she herself existed on fringe
                ontology, a form of superposition with her more frequently
                existing sisters, she felt an attraction to the people for whom
                absence of perception meant extinction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus Lina became the patron saint of Orgon. Using her mystical
                and un-figurable powers bestowed upon her as "the HOYL", she
                would reinforce the power of Orgonite at the same rate as the
                power of Orgonite naturally waned. However, using her powers
                like this was taking its toll on Lina, and in her weakened
                state, on one fateful day, misfortune would strike like
                lightning.

            <h1>And The Orgonite Case Would Begin...</h1>
            <p>
                Goblin-Goblin Nor√© had been at the scene of the crime, at the
                time of the crime, with a gun in his hand. He knew that if word
                got out, he would be convicted as the first and the last
                criminal of Orgon. He needed help. As the concept of a "Police"
                was unheard-of in Orgon, he had no idea what kind of help he
                actually needed, nor (if said "Police" had been a concept heard
                of in Orgon) if such a "Police" would even help him then.
            </p>
            <p>
                He had a feeling he needed something to do with "law", and
                preferably someone who had a gun. A faint memory from year ago
                floated to the top of his cognitive soup. Who were those guys?
                Law-Gun? "Ah ye", he thought, "those will do".....
