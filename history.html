<h1>History</h>
<p>Previously, people have competed. These are results.</p>
</center><marquee><b><u><i>LAGGAN NEWS:</b></u></i>
<u>29/5/2021</u>: Lag-Gan wins the Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart sport. @Naone is plagued with the Goblinscourge. 
<u>5/6/2021</u>: Lag-Gan wins the Ace of Spades sport. Burying intelligence is looked down upon.
<u>18/6/2021</u>: The first (of many) draws as a result of "unclear" ruleset in the Zero-K sport. @Tod the cunning and wise made an unwise decision regarding zombies.
<u>3/7/2021</u>: Lag-Lag scores their first real win in the Empty Epsilon sport. A very clever goblin-based-alternate-reality-game is played. @Naone recovers. 
<u>17/7/2021</u>: Lag-Gan wins at Barotrauma. @Makeep sees fit to fudge the rule of democracy a little bit. A commendable decision.
<u>31/7/2021</u>: The first ever <b><i><u>Septogame - The Seating of Septothrone</b></i></u> is held. I don't remember all the details, but just like before there's some weird judge ruling. Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart, Ace of Spades, Not-Hockey Questionmark and finally Killer Queen Black might have been the games. Gamecubes are spent and forgotten. A jigsaw puzzle becomes the most appreciated game of the tournament. </marquee>
