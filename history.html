		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>Previously, people have competed. These are results.</p>
	</div>
	<div style="padding: 10%; background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);">On the <span class="STRONK">7th of November</span>,
		the first <span class="STRONK">Laggan
			Single Player Torunament</span> was played, testing the athletes in the honorable
		sport of Melee.<br>
		12 players in total joined the competition, with skill levels ranging from those who had participated in local
		tournaments and knew all about framedata and L-canelling, to first-timers with no previous Melee
		experience.<br><br>

		The group stages began with <span class="rolig_fÃ¤rg">@uschtvii#4333</span> taking a convincing lead, with 11
		straight clean wins. Having lost just once, right behind him was <span class="disc_jockey">@Maakep#8596</span>,
		the only member of
		Laggan who had not done any training in advance for the tournament, instead relying solely on the latent
		strength of the pattented <span class="disc_jockey">Maakep</span> Gaming factor. In third place was <span
			class="disc_jockey">@Haj#0188</span>, just one win short on Maakep, with his
		unpredictably dangerous Yoshi movement.<br><br>

		For the first half of the Main Tournament it seemed like the seeds of prophecy sown in the soils of the group
		stage would come bloom to fruition; <span class="rolig_fÃ¤rg">@uschtvii#4333</span>
		undefeated and the top players asserting their dominance.<br>
		But then as the two runner ups and old friends <span class="disc_jockey">@Maakep#8596</span> and <span
			class="disc_jockey">@Haj#0188</span> faced off for the second time, a shift occured.
		<span class="disc_jockey">@Maakep#8596</span> forsaking his trusty Marth, instead bringing out the Ganondorf and
		then the Falco. And <span class="disc_jockey">@Haj#0188</span> would offer some new moves in return, unveiling
		his ferocious Fox.
		Suddenly, <span class="disc_jockey">@Haj#0188</span> took a historic win against his friend and Melee rival of
		10 years. And thus the seals of old had been broken.<br>
		<span class="hot_dog">@snygghugo#5201</span> battled and won against both <span
			class="smashing">@wannehed#3256</span> and <span class="disc_jockey">@Maakep#8596</span>, both of whom had
		previously categorically rekt him.<br>
		But most surprisingly broke the throne, <span class="disc_jockey">@Haj#0188</span> taking 3 games off of <span
			class="rolig_fÃ¤rg">@uschtvii#4333</span> before an astounded audience, sending <span
			class="rolig_fÃ¤rg">@uschtvii#4333</span> to the lower bracket.
		<span class="rolig_fÃ¤rg">@uschtvii#4333</span> looked beaten the first game against <span
			class="hot_dog">@snygghugo#5201</span> in the losers finals, but <span
			class="rolig_fÃ¤rg">@uschtvii#4333</span> steadily regained his
		composure to ensure a striking 3-1 win, ending the small piece of the hero's journey that <span
			class="hot_dog">@snygghugo#5201</span> had tasted.<br><br>
		Once again <span class="disc_jockey">@Haj#0188</span> - the presumed bronze medalist and <span
			class="rolig_fÃ¤rg">@uschtvii#4333</span> - who most had assumed to take the crown, were facing
		off in the Winners Finals. Both players now looking unbelievably strong, each taking one game at a time off of
		the other, until <span class="rolig_fÃ¤rg">@uschtvii#4333</span> finally siezed the final win to complete the
		set, and thus confirming the bracket reset.
		In the Grand Final the avians felt confident, with <span class="rolig_fÃ¤rg">@uschtvii#4333</span> taking a solid
		game off of, but the dino bros of <span class="disc_jockey">@Haj#0188</span>
		knew that their Yoshi was playing out of his mind, out of this world, and always just out of <span
			class="rolig_fÃ¤rg">@uschtvii#4333</span>'s reach.<br><br>
		In the end, the Laggan Oficiall Melee Torunament 2021 could have just been called <span class="STRONK">"Yoshi's
			Story".</span><br><br>

			the first showing of the future Grand Champion of All Of Smash.....</p>

		Laggan Official Melee Tournament 2021 was made brought to life and made possible by Legendary Osu Player and
		Adequate Smash Gamer <span class="disc_jockey">@borzoi#8259</span>, who set everything up and acted as TO. A
		herculean effort!
		It wouldn't have been half as fun if it wasn't for the commentary of the Legendary Smash Player and Adequate Osu
		Player <span class="yapos">@PoppmðŸ…°ister6000#7105</span>, backed up by Laggan New Blood and co-host <span
			class="smashing">@wannehed#3256</span>.<br><br>
		<span class="STRONK">And it wouldn't have become the great grand thing that it became if it were not for
			everyone, of all skill
			levels, of all bracket results, joining together to watch and cheer and fight and frollick in
			general! Big thanks to @everyone who participated!</span>

			title="The foundation of what would later become the Alliance Dota 2 team was laid when Swedish DotA veteran Loda, who had just left Singaporean Team Zenith after their dissolution following The International 2012, was approached by a sponsor (which would later become the Alliance organization) asking him if he was interested in putting together a team.[1] Looking back at the glory days of his early career, his decision was to try to go with an all-swedish lineup in the same spirit as his oldest and most successful team, SK Gaming of the 2008 era. He and fellow Swedish support veteran Akke's, eyes fell upon rising Swedish solo-mid star s4, whom Loda had noticed during their HoN days. s4 and AdmiralBulldog were playing for the new upstart team No Tidehunter created by s4 and Canadian support player EternaLEnVy. In late October 2012, it was announced that Loda and Akke had joined team No Tidehunter,[2] only one month before Dreamhack Winter 2012 which the team had qualified for with a mixed roster including German carry Black^. Winning the DreamHack Winter tournament in such short time after the Swedish veteran duo's inclusion surprised many and established the team as one of the best teams in the west. During the finals, in which they were trailing 0-1, they managed to bait the entire EG squad into checking the Roshan-pit with an ingenious suicide by AdmiralBulldogs Natures Prophet, and subsequently getting the first blood and eventually turning the finals in front of the home crowd.[3] Alliance did not exist as an organization as of yet, but the team confirmed during the event that they were under contract by an unknown organization and that all the players had their trip to JonkÃ¶ping paid for, including current captain EternaLEnVy who was flown in all the way from Canada." />,
