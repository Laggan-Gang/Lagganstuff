	<h1><span class="sports">@Sports</span> = NIGH MANDATORY</h1>
	<p>The role invented to ping people interested in the first Lagganational, now used to ping whoever might be interested in competitive games of the unknown or untested variety. Anyone can host a <span class="sports">@Sports</span>, and anyone can join a <span class="sports">@Sports</span>. It's Laggan for Laggan, Laggan for all!</p>
	<h1><span class="yapos">@yapos</span> = Dota 2</h1>
		<p>Dota 2 is a game about five people versus five other people who say one thing and then do another for 30-60 minutes until it's over. After that someone says "we didn't move very well around the map" and another game is played.</p>
	<h1><span class="pugs">@pugs</span> = PUBG</h1>
	<p>PUBG is a game about Potchinki and riding motorcycles, or sitting in bushes a lot.</p>
	<h1><span class="gosi">@gosi</span> = Counter-Strike: GO</h1>
	<p>Counter-Strike, to my understanding, is some form of grievence settling game wherein one player demands an apology of another, and if the demand is refused, shoots them in the head.</p>
	<h1><span class="disc_jockey">@disc jockey</span> = DJ</h1>
	<p>This is not a game, it's just the required role to control Gulliga Roboten.</p>
	<h1><span class="regndansare">@regndansare</span> = Risk of Rain</h1>
	<p>Risk of Rain is a game where you pick a guy and then run around picking up things and shoot other things until someone declares "I'm very weak, I need more items next stage" and then you lose unless you go to the OP void tunnel thing and just crush the game. It's fun!</p>
	<h1><span class="starbux">@STARBUX</span> = Starbound</h1>
	<p>Starbound is a lot like Terraria, it has a lot of content and multiplayer. However it's not really better than Terraria and it's kind of dumb and over-patched. It feels like No Man's Sky, there was a bad core gameplay loop and now it has a hundred bad core gameplay loops.</p>
	<h1><span class="aporna">@aporna</span> = Apex Legends</h1>
	<p>Apex Legends is a game where two people run around shouting constantly while <span class="rolig_färg">@uschtvii#4333</span> carries the entire team.</p>
	<h1><span class="smashing">@SMASHING</span> = Super Smash Brothers Melee</h1>
	<p>It's Smash lol it's fun!!!!</p>
	<h1><span class="weebs">@weebs</span> = Det där weeb spelet</h1>
	<p>I can't be arsed to look it up but for a dark time some members played a real 'meh' weeb game and it was ok I guess but I'm glad we stopped</p>
	<h1><span class="onlyfans">@onlyfans</span> = Kolla Streams</h1>
	<p>A role just for getting pings whenever someone starts a stream if you're interested in just watching, if you like to watch.</p>
	<h1><span class="slunga_snorre">@slunga snorre</span> = self explanatory</h1>
	<h1><span class="terrans">@Terrans</span> = Terraria</h1>
	<p>Terraria is fucking great and I'd love to play it once again.</p>
	<h1><span class="barabaras">@Barabaras</span> = Barotrauma</h1>
	<p>A pretty nice submarine commanding game focused on survival and teamplay. Lots of risk/reward things and communication needed. Hijinxs ensue!</p>
	<h1><span class="scrobbl3s">@SCR0BBL3S</span> = skribbl.io</h1>
	<p>A pretty fun pictionary game we played as a 'between games' kind of game. It's nice!</p>
	<h1><span class="jordens_försvarare">@Jordens Försvarare</span> = Earth Defense Force</h1>
	<p>A fucking phenomenal game about shooting huge ants with huge guns and bad one-liners. 10/10 stuff.</p>
	<h1><span class="rockandstone">@ROCKANDSTONE</span> = Deep Rock Galactic</h1>
	<p>A really really nice multiplayer third-person digging/shooting/logistics-type of game about a bunch of dwarfs doing dwarf things. A lot better than it should be and looks like. Real nice.</p>
	<h1><span class="OwOs">@OwOs</span> = Overwatch</h1>
	<p>Overwatch is a hero action shooter about Pixar people who shoot each other I guess, it has been described as "crack cocaine" during the week it was played 24/7 and promptly never touched again.</p>
	<h1><span class="moonslam">@Moonslam</span> = Sonic Robo Blast 2: Kart</h1>
	<p>A TERRIFIC Mario Kart-like that's just fucking BONKERS good and fun. Download and mod link can be found on this page and I'm not arsed to put it in here, but I might one day. Someone should start spamming <span class="moonslam">@Moonslam</span></p>
	<h1><span class="queens">@queens</span> = Killer Queen Black</h1>
	<p>A fantastic 4v4 snail racing simulator with hunter/gather mechanics that almost no one place, despite it being the hottest fucking shit and absolutely banging in every way.</p>
	<h1><span class="galapågar">@Galapågar</span> = Natural Selection 2</h1>
	<p>A pretty cool asymmetric multiplayer game with a tried and true "Marines vs Aliens" premise, one player on each team plays an RTS while their friends shoot the goons.</p> 
	<h1><span class ="lergrabben">@lergrabben</span> = Legion TD</h1>
	<p>This game was played in December <span class="stronk">AND</span> in January!</p>
	<h1><span class ="tribals">@tribals = TRIBES: ASCEND BABYYYY</span></h1>
	<p>SHAZBOT this game is just fucking FANTASTIC. Big multiplayer CTF game where you can go fast, go slow, go anywhere in between. It's fucking fantastic and if you disagree you're a sandraker.</p>
	<h1><span class="h4ck3rs">@h4ck3rs</span> = ....????</h1>
	<p>HACKERS use this tag to meet up in SECRET CHANNELS wherein they plan ALL SORTS OF DEGENERACY.</p>
	<h1><span class="lost_boys">@lost boys</span> = Lost Ark</h1>
	<p>The Lost Boys have done a lot of planning, and tomorrow the game releases. Maybe we will play for more than a month.</p>
	<h1><span class="deicide">@deicide</span> = Smite</h1>
	<p>Yes, that *other* Hi-Rez game... It's a 3d moba I guess</p>
	<h1><span class="sussy_bakas">@sussy bakas</span> = Social Deduction Games</h1>
	<p>For things like secret neighbour, among us, winter world, freak in the sheets, learner or the burner, slappy cake and Flip-Fl0p.</p>
