                THE INTERNETIONAL 2:THE ORGONITE CASE - PLAYER MANUAL
            </h1>
            <h2 style="text-align: center">OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>
                The Internetional 2: The Orgonite Case is the sequel to the
                Internetional. In simple terms, it's a way to get the people of
                Laggan to test their competitive spirit on completely new
                grounds. In more complicated terms it's a
                <i>gesamtkunstwerk</i> where the weird ideas of mine are forced
                upon the people of Laggan under the guise of competitive spirit.
                The game is played as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                Every fortnight (even Saturdays to be precise, but if you want
                to change date of an event please let me know and we'll work
                something out) an event is held. In the previous year, said
                event was comprised of two parts: the Pre-Game and the Main
                Game. In this year's edition, these two elements remain the same
                and serve the same function, but this year they are joined by a
                Narrative Element.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Narrative Element can be seen as an optional Pre-Pre-Game
                (signing up for the game does not mean you sign up for the
                Narrative Element, any and all are welcome to participate). As
                <b
                    >the main goal of The Internetional 2: The Orgonite Case is
                    to solve a murder</b
                >
                it is quite important that at least some people from each team
                are interested in this part, as it will provide clues and
                context for the murder mystery at hand (as long as one person on
                each team has an idea of what's going on, that's enough - but
                the more the merrier). The Narrative Element will be an
                opportunity for some light roleplaying fun while asking the
                potential suspects what their relation to the case might be.
                It's also what the music is for.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Narrative Element solves two things I felt were lacking in
                last year's rendition; 1) It provides a better framework for the
                narrative (which I hope will enhance the competitive spirit!)
                and 2) it provides a more cohesive tactical advantage for the
                final. "What the fuck" you might be saying, "how would a dumb
                wannabe-noir story possibly provide any meaningful change to the
                way the final is played, how could it possibly provide a
                substantial tactical advantage while still providing enough room
                for competition that an underdog might take home the entire
                tournament while clearly losing all the preceeding games?" Good
                question!
            </p>
            <p>
                The reward for winning a Main Game is a specific piece of
                evidence. The evidence might be, for example, be a photograph of
                the scene of the crime minutes before the crime happened.
                However,
                <b
                    >because in the City of Orgon the truth sleeps in a box with
                    Schr√∂dinger's cat</b
                >, the evidence remains in a state of superposition - its
                contents undecided until perceived, and it can only be perceived
                by the one possessing the evidence.
                <b
                    >When you win a game, you get to decide the truth of a
                    matter</b
                >. When the final game comes into play,
                <b
                    >this evidence can help you support your conclusion for what
                    it is that transpired on The Night That Lina Died</b
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final game, of course, is to unravel the truth of The
                Orgonite Case.
            </p>
            <h2>TEAMS</h2>
            <p>
                Last year there was a lot of swapping around teams. Two new
                systems are introduced to help combat this. The first is a form
                of team loyalty score, in which participating in a game with
                your team earns you +1 loyalty score. This means that if there's
                a need to swap players around, the one with the lowest loyalty
                score (and thus least connection to their team) will be
                sacrificed to the other team. Losing a game when playing for the
                opposite team earns you 100 loyalty score. The other new system
                is the ability to sign up for an event 13 days in advance (after
                an event is held, the next day Sunday marks the start for
                sign-ups for the next event). Sign-ups take precedence over
                loyalty score, so if you don't have a lot of time but really
                want to play Halo for example, the sign-up is the option for
                you. But if things get out of hand I'll change the rules.
                Failing to show up for an event you've signed up for will give
                negative loyalty score. Attending Narrative Elements and/or
                theorycrafting in the team channel also gives loyalty score.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the final game, of course, is to unravel the truth of
                The Orgonite Case.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>tl;dr</b>: Games are played every even Saturday (all dates
                <a href="internetional2.html"
                    ><span style="color: white; text-decoration: underline"

                    ></a
                >). First there's an optional Narrative Element, then the teams
                play a Pre-Game and a Main Game. Winning a game offers you
                slight omnipotence, which will help prove that your conclusion
                on what happened in Orgon is the truth. (It's like
                reverse-Clue).
